# Interview Prep

I started this work to prepare for my interviews, and decided to open source this to help other candidates.

* *coding/*: contains actual exercises. To verify your understanding of algorithms, edit *work.cpp*, compile everything and run *tests.cpp*. This will test your implementation with provided tests and hopefully those will detect errors in your implementation. Remember that the tests verify that your sorting algorithms can sort both in normal and reverse order. You can find the solutions to the problems in answer.txt (old) or in my new public [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O4e02NYJLf7jnBv4SHsPdku4eDVFurZsukSpLDGlTtM/edit?usp=sharing) for this purpose.
* *cs/*: contains more mathematical notions relevant to computer science (complexity notations, master theorem etc).
* *cpp/*: contains some C++ notions (up to C++14) that I was learning at the time. Not really up to date but still relevant for interviews if you choose C++ for your interview. Only latex at the moment.
